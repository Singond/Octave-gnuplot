Title: Gnuplot bindings for Octave
Description: Enables controlling Gnuplot from within Octave.
 While Octave supports Gnuplot natively, it abstracts from its details and
 makes fine-grained control over the final result difficult. This utility aims
 to fill this gap by providing more direct control over what is being passed
 to Gnuplot.
