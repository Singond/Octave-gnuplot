Gnuplot bindings for Octave
===========================

Enables controlling Gnuplot from within Octave.
While Octave supports Gnuplot natively, it abstracts from its details and makes
fine-grained control over the final result difficult. This utility aims to fill
this gap by providing more direct control over what is being passed to Gnuplot.
